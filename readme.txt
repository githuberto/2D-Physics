GENERAL
-----------------------------
-This is a simple 2D physics engine written in Java.

-Collision calculations are primarily based off of Randy
 Gaul's "How to Create a Custom 2D Physics Engine" series.
 However, the main loop, visual rendering, and overall
 structure are all original work.

FUTURE PLANS
-----------------------------
-Add friction and rotation

-Implement point mass gravitation

-Implement Coulomb's law charge interations
